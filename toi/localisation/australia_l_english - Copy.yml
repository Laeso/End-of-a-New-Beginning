 AST_eureka_desc:0 "Only a few years ago, a large group of miners started a small revolt in an act of deffiance against new mining taxes and regulations. They won what they wanted, however lost the battle overall. The result of it is still ongoing, and its effects although small will be seen for a long time to come."
 AST_unexplored_lands:0 "Unexplored Regions"
 AST_unexplored_lands:0 "Vast regions of our land are currently unexplored. This means we do not know how many resources, how much wealth, or how many potential city sites exist in much of our claimed land."
 AST_aboriginal_tribes:0 "Oppresion of the Aboriginal Tribes"
 AST_aboriginal_tribes:0 "The natives of these lands still somewhat control many of the unexplored areas of our nation. Naturally, They are against our rulership. They also seem to be unorganised and unadvanced, although they do seem to live a much happier life than we europeans, at least did until we claimed the land for Britain. They seem to take great effect to us and are dying off from disease rather quickly, which is unfortunate."
