 holland_oog.1.d:0 "Hello guys!! Thanks for trying out the Netherlands in EoanB! I'm jppeer123, been working on the Netherlands for the past couple of weeks and we've been making some good progress so far. As a quick headsup I just gotta say that the Netherlands isn't done, like at all, the focus tree isn't anything near done or filled in fully, the decisions and events are in their infancy and the Netherlands is just generally not ready for playing right now, but if you insist on trying out this content you may go ahead and play! Thanks for Testing the Netherlands out and I hope to receive some feedback on the EoanB discord very soon! Good luck ;P"
